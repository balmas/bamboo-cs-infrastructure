                             Bamboo 0.0.1
                            --------------

The modules are divided into five main areas:

 Client - allows querying of the Bamboo Corpora Space environment

 Agent  - allows responding to queries in the Bamboo CS environment

 Server - acts as the switchboard between Clients and Agents

 Engine - provides some portable computational power across Agents, 
          Clients, and Servers

 Shell  - provides a command-line interface to the Bamboo CS environment

The scripts in ./examples demonstrate how the Client, Agent, and Server
can work.

To install the modules:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install
