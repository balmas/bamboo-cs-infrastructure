= bamboo-cs-infrastructure

== DESCRIPTION:

This repository has proofs of concept for the various components in the
proposed Bamboo Copora Space infrastructure.  Each set of libraries is
prefixed by the implementation language.

See the READMEs in each component for more information.

We are using the 'Utukku' name as a place holder since these libraries are
not officialy part of Bamboo.

For more information on how to use the libraries to build a server, client,
or agent, see {the Corpora Camp planning document}[https://wiki.projectbamboo.org/display/BTECH/Corpora+Camp+Platform+API].

N.B.: The Perl libraries are not being maintained for now.  The Ruby and
JavaScript libraries are undergoing development in preparation for
Corpora Camp.

== LICENSE

All of the files in this repository should be considered closed for now while
we work through the initial development.  Please don't redistribute the files
beyond the Corpora Space/Camp working groups until we have more definite
licensing in place.
