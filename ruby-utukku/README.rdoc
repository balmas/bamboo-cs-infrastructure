= ruby-utukku

This is the Ruby version of the Utukku libraries.

== Example

In the examples/ directory are three example scripts that show how the
various pieces fit together.  Run them in the following order with a
couple seconds between each.

% cd ruby-utukku
% ruby -Ilib ./examples/utukku-server
% ruby -Ilib -Iexamples/lib ./examples/utukku-agent
% ruby -Ilib ./examples/utukku-client

The client will print out its progress towards 1,000,000 doublings through
the agent.
